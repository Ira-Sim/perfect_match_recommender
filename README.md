## [The Challenge](https://www.hackbay.de/)
### The proposed solution
We created a recommender system for websites based on their targeted socio demographics using deep learning.
This method bypasses the use of cookies to understand the specific target user group of website. Based on this information, it recommends various modifications or improvements for the website. For example, the number of images, color schemes to use for the website, keywwords to include etc.


## How to use

Clone the repo
`git clone https://github.com/antaradas94/perfect_match_recommender.git`

Then do the following to install the packages. Note, this Repo requires a Python 3.8 environment.

```
cd perfect_match_recommender
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

When you have installed all necessary packages, you can run the app using
`streamlit run app.py`
